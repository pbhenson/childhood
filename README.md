These are just a handful of random things I wrote around about 1988-1989. Some
are in BASIC (Microsoft QuickBASIC as I recall) and the others are in Borland
Turbo Pascal.


DARTS.BAS - a simple dart throwing game


Once upon a time a friend of mine and I wrote a simple Othello clone for the
Commodore 128. I lost track of the source code to that one, but all of the
following are various ports of it to the PC compatible platform:

EGAHIRES.BAS
SWITCH.BAS
SWITCH.PAS
OTHELLO.BAS


These are some simple Turbo Pascal utilities and convenience functions. One of
them is a text window generator which outputs code to be included in a
different program that uses the windows. I remember one of my undergraduate
classes assigned a project which was similar in that you needed to write a
program whose output was a program, and it amazed me how many of my classmates
simply could not grasp the concept.

DESIGNW.PAS
GRID.PAS
IO.PAS
QKWNDWS.PAS


WORDSRCH.PAS - a basic word search program utilizing the above


Maybe one of these days enough nostalgia will hit me to warrant setting up a
DOSBox instance with QuickBASIC and Turbo Pascal and actually try to run them
again...
